# Requirements

## Essential Connectivity

- **Amazon API Connection:**  
  - The workflow requires a working connection to the Amazon MCF API.
  - **If the Amazon API is not connected or not properly configured, no fulfillment or inventory update actions will be performed.**
  - The script will halt and log an error if Amazon connectivity is missing.

- **TikTok Shop API Connection:**  
  - The workflow requires a valid connection to the TikTok Shop API.
  - **If the TikTok Shop API is not connected or not properly configured, no order fetching, status updates, or related actions will be performed.**
  - The script will halt and log an error if TikTok connectivity is missing.

## SKU Matching

- **SKU Consistency:**  
  - SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) for products must match exactly between TikTok Shop and Amazon.
  - The system assumes your entire product portfolio is imported from Amazon, ensuring identical SKUs on both platforms.
  - **If a SKU does not match between platforms, a unique identifier should be created and mapped to ensure accurate fulfillment and inventory management.**
    - THIS IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CODE, ITS DOABLE BUT NOT IN THE CODE.
  - Failure to match SKUs may result in unfulfilled orders or inventory mismatches.

## Python Library Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the workflow scripts:

- `requests`  
  For making HTTP requests to TikTok Shop API and Amazon MCF API.

- `logging`  
  For standardized logging and error reporting across all scripts.

- `os`  
  For environment variable and file path management.

- `json`  
  For parsing and serializing JSON data to and from the APIs.

- `time`  
  For handling delays, rate limiting, and time-based operations.

- `datetime`  
  For timestamp processing and date comparisons.

- `typing`  
  For type hints and static code analysis.

- `dotenv` (if using environment files)  
  For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.  
  _Install with:_  
  ```bash
  pip install python-dotenv
  ```

> **Install all dependencies using:**
> ```bash
> pip install requests python-dotenv
> ```
> *(Standard libraries such as `logging`, `os`, `json`, `time`, `datetime`, and `typing` are included with Python 3.x and do not require installation.)*

## Additional Notes

- Ensure all API credentials and endpoints are up to date and valid before running the workflow.
- Review logs regularly to catch connectivity or SKU-matching errors early.
